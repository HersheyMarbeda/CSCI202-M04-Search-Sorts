# CSCI 202: M04-Search/Sort

## Assignment Description
1. Write and test two programs
    - Use selection sort for linked lists.
    - Use merge sort for linked lists. 
2. Compare the efficiency between the merge and selection sort.
3. Test with AT LEAST lists with these number of elements
    - 1
    - 10
    - 100
    - 1000
4. You will need to know the time in milliseconds to run each and graph the comparison of n vs time.

## My Methods
1. I used '<ctime>' to measure the time for both Selection and Merge Sorts for N = 100,000. I also used one class to make the Selection and Merge Sorts.
